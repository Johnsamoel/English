<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


My project is about an English Examination system which targets students who are willing to examine their English knowledge by answering some questions, each time you will receive different questions and you are not only receiving the questions, but also you can listen to it's pronounciation in case you don't know it, at the end of the test you will receive your final score.



### Built With
In this project I tented to used different libraries to implement my idea in a proper way, First off I used React.js as a framework to implement the SPA principles, I also implemented system design by using material UI and I tented to use TypeScript to write strong Typed , organised and clean code.

Regarding the server side I used Node.js to create and api's.

* [React.js](https://ar.reactjs.org)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Material ui](https://mui.com)
